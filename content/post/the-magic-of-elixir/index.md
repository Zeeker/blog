I'm a big fan of elixir and FP (functional programming) in general.

__But__ this wasn't always the case.
Before I became a function slinging backend developer I was mostly working Swift and from time to time in PHP.
I felt very cozy in my little object-oriented programming (OOP) corner.
I liked my objects, I happily used inheritance (maybe a bit much), I was scared of concurrency, and at the end of the day I got paid.

So how did I discover elixir and learned to appreciate FP, this "strange" world beyond OOP?
<!-- What is it, which makes me feel so at home? -->
<!-- So how did I fell in love with elixir in the first place, and why? -->
<!-- So how did I discover elixir and why do I -->

## The Past and the Future

As you might have guessed - based on the tech - I mostly built mobile applications for iOS.

The funny part is: I never owned an Apple device.
To this day I never used an iPhone for anything except development purposes.

I've always owned an Android device and to this day I'm fully immersed in the Google ecosystem.
The only exception was my very first "smart"phone: the amazing HTC HD2 which ran the even more amazing Windows Mobile 6.5.

<!-- Nowadays I rock a Asus ZenPhone 6, yes, the one with the rotating camera. -->
<!-- I'm fully immersed in the Android/Google ecosytem. -->

That thing was horrible in hindsight.
But I'm digressing.

<!-- But when I started at this small company in 2015 they needed additional iOS developers. -->
You see, when I started at this small company in 2015 they needed additional iOS developers.
I was the new guy, so of course I sat down and learned Objective-C - which was still used in 100% of their apps.
<!-- When I started at this company in 2015 they were still completely on the Objective-C train. -->

I built 1 or two apps using this wonderful language after which we saw the promised land that was Swift.
After that we sticked with Swift and never looked back.

While I enjoyed working in Swift - I still consider it a very solid language - I didn't like having to build "pixel-perfect" UIs.
As a small company (we were around 6 people) we had no inhouse designers.
<!-- You see we were a small company with no inhouse designers. -->
Which in turn meant customers pretty much always dumped "finished" designs on our desks.

<!-- Designs created in Photoshop, by some designers who finally had the opportunity to design in fantasy wonderland with no regards to technical limitations. -->
<!-- After all it was not their problem down the road right? -->

Let's just say that these designs had no regards for technical limitations.

<!-- As you can imagine this did grind my gears but what can you do? -->


<!-- Why is concurrency hard? -->
## Concurrency

<!-- Why do pure functions help? -->
## Pure Functions

<!-- What do I miss in elixir? -->
## Strong type system

<!-- What do I not miss from OOP? -->
## Inheritance
