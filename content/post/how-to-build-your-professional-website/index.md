There are a million questions with seemingly even more answers.

# What you will learn

In this post you will learn how to:

- easily create your site using [hugo][hugo]
- deploy and host your page with [now][now]
- setup your own domain
- use [github][github] to automatically deploy everything on push

At the end of this you'll have all the skills necessary to create a website **just like this one**.

*Note: This post assumes you have some basic knowledge about the command line and git.*

# Create your page using [hugo][hugo]

Hugo claims to be "the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites".
I have no idea if that's true but I can say that it's easy to setup, use, and produces great results.
<!-- But I'm getting ahead of myself. -->
In this section we will pretty much follow along [hugo's quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
So if you would rather read that, go ahead.
No hard feelings.

So, assuming you're on macOS installing hugo is as simple as typing into your CLI:

```sh
brew install hugo
```

<!-- After that you can create the basic framework of your future site by typing: -->
After that you can create your future site by typing:

```sh
hugo new site my-great-future-site
```

<!-- This will create a folder called (you might have guessed it) `my-great-future-site`. -->
This will create a folder called - you might have guessed it - `my-great-future-site`.
<!-- You could now use `hugo server` to see how it looks, but **spoiler** that would be pretty boring. -->
You could now use `hugo server` to see how it looks, but (**spoiler**) it's pretty boring.
By default hugo generates an empty page with nothing in it.
So how do we make it pretty?

This is where themes come into play.

## Picking a theme

Hugo offers a number of themes, most of them contributed by the community.
In this tutorial I'll go with the [tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) simply because it's the one you're looking at right now.
Feel free to look through [the other ones hugo is offering](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
